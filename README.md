In computer science, binary is a number system that only uses two digits: 1 and 0. 
All information processed by a computer is in the form of a sequence of 1s and 0s. 
This system is called binary because it is base-2, meaning it only uses two digits or bits. 
For computers, 1 represents "true" or "on," while 0 represents "false" or "off". 
Binary is used to represent numbers and letters in a way that computers can understand. 
It's the foundation of digital information and data storage‚Å¥.
